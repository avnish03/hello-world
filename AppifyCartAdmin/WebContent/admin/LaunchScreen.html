<body>
A launch screen appears instantly when your app starts up. 
The launch screen is quickly replaced with the first screen of your app, giving the impression that your app is fast and responsive.
The launch screen isn’t an opportunity for artistic expression. 
It’s solely intended to enhance the perception of your app as quick to launch and immediately ready for use. Every app must supply a launch screen.
<li>The launch screen should be image of size 1080x1920 in jpg, jpeg or png format only.</li>
